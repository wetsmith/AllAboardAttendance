In order to promote legibility and agility, please follow these guidelines on how to format your code.

	1. Descriptive and fitting variable names.

	2. Frequent, detailed code comments. Note the mechanism of each block and function. Note parts that were challenging. Note things you think might cause trouble down the line. Note things that shouldn't be touched. Not things that SHOULD be touched. Note what you're proud of, or what you think should be redone in future revisions.

	3. If you made assumptions on what another incomplete or in-progress task, document where you made them. For example, if you're expecting  a certain input but aren't 100% sure what that input will look like, comment what you assumed.

	4. Common sense comments. Civil, clear, and descriptive. "IDK LOL" next to a messy block of code isn't going to cut it!

These guidelines are WIP and subject to change.
